"Sometimes people are lucky and support for their project directly comes in from all corners of the world. However, for the other 99%% it starts with their own network and their networksâ€™ network. This basically means you have to tell your network about your project on 1%%Club. Once, twice, maybe even three times. Per e-mail, on Facebook, on Twitter, face-to-face, by phone, by poster or in a video message. Whatever you need to do to get them on board! Our advice would be to have some people on board to help you do this.<br/><br/>\n"
"Do realize that you have to put in work to make it work. And remember, hard work tends to pays off. You have 6 months for this campaign so use it wisely. If you donâ€™t succeed the money will go back to the people who gave it and they will choose another project.<br/><br/>\n"
